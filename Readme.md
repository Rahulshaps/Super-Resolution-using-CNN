# Super-Resolution using CNN (SRCNN)

## Project Summary
This project implements a compact 3-layer convolutional neural network that maps low-resolution images to higher-resolution reconstructions. The goal is to provide a clear and reproducible baseline for single-image super-resolution with minimal complexity while retaining the core ideas of SRCNN.

## What the Model Does
- Takes an upscaled low-resolution image as input and predicts a refined high-resolution image.
- Learns an end-to-end mapping from LR to HR in RGB space.
- Targets fast inference and a small memory footprint suitable for class projects and quick experiments.

## Method at a Glance
1. **Preprocess**: Start from a low-resolution image and obtain a bicubic-upsampled version at the desired scale (for example, 2x).
2. **SRCNN Pass**: Feed the upsampled image through a 3-layer CNN to enhance edges, textures, and fine details.
3. **Output**: Produce a super-resolved image with improved perceptual sharpness and higher PSNR relative to the bicubic baseline.

## Architecture
- **Layer 1**: 3 input channels to 128 feature maps, kernel size 9, ReLU
- **Layer 2**: 128 to 64 feature maps, kernel size 5, ReLU
- **Layer 3**: 64 to 3 output channels, kernel size 5
- **Loss and Metrics**: Mean squared error for training objective; PSNR for quality reporting

This architecture mirrors the classic SRCNN design with 9-5-5 kernels and channel widths 3->128->64->3.

## Data and Preprocessing
- Uses a small public dataset for convenience (for example, STL-10) and creates paired LR and HR samples.
- LR images are generated by downscaling and then bicubic upscaling to the target size before SRCNN refinement.

## Results Snapshot
- Reference run achieved about **28.0 dB PSNR** on the test split with **~0.05 s per image** inference on a modern GPU.
- Higher PSNR typically requires larger datasets and longer training schedules than this lightweight baseline.

## Inference Notes
- Python notes for running inference are included in the repository notebooks (for example, `notebooks/Inference.ipynb`).
- These notes demonstrate how to load a trained checkpoint and produce super-resolved outputs from your images.
